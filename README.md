# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a C++ program that applies a range of filters and orthographic projections to input 2D images or 3D data volumes. This program includes eight 2D image filters, two 3D data volume filters, and 3D image projections and slices. 

# File list
- Filter.cpp & Filter.h: the code for Filter class
- Image.cpp & Image.h: the code for Image class
- Volumn.cpp & Volumn.h: the code for Volume class
- 3d_ops.cpp & 3d_ops.h: the code for Slicing class
- Projection.cpp & Projection.h: the code for Projection class
- User.h: the code for user interface
- Output folder: Output images
- Group Kruskal Report.doc: report
- Unit tests: tests for filtering and projection
- License
- Documentation in html format

# Installation
To use this library, you will need to have the following dependency installed:
STB Image for reading and writing image files
